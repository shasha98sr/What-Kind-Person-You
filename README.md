# What Kind of Person You Are ðŸŽ­

Remember "The Big Book of Fun" from childhood? This was my first coding project (ps. I have not made any changes to it since), bringing that nostalgic personality quiz into the digital world. Try it here: [Live Demo](https://shasha98sr.github.io/What-Kind-Person-You/)

## The Story Behind
Back in high school, I found an old copy of "The Big Book of Fun" that I used to love as a kid. The book had this fun quiz about friendship types that my friends and I would take over and over. One day in my computer class, while learning HTML and CSS, it hit me - I could turn this into a website!

This project marked my first real dive into coding. What started as a simple "What if?" turned into late nights of figuring out HTML tags, wrestling with CSS, and the pure joy of seeing my childhood memories transform into something digital that I created. It might be simple, but it's where I discovered that I could actually build things with code.

## Features
- Digital version of the classic friendship quiz
- Simple but nostalgic design
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Instant results - way faster than calculating by hand!

## Built With
